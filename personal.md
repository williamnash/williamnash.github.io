I am from the town of [Northampton][northampton], Massachusetts known for it's food, music, and colorful folk. I am the oldest among my two sisters and spent my youth building forts in the woods in my backyard, playing with legos, jumping off of dams, filming movies, and injuring myself learning to skateboard.

I moved to Boston for school in 2010, where I was exposed to a diverse class of students many of whom have become lifelong friends. I enjoyed going for runs along the Charles River and miss the delicious food available on demand at nearly all hours. While at school I became scholarship chair of my [fraternity][sigma-alpha-mu], president of the [BU PC gaming club][bu-pc-gaming], and later travelled abroad after being accepted into the [Geneva Physics program][geneva-program], which would kick-start my career in Particle Physics.

I continued to live in the area after I graduated after getting a job in Littleton, MA and would spend my mornings and nights reading on the commuter rail travelling in and out of North Station.

I moved to Los Angeles after being accepted into graduate school in 2016 and quickly got used to the nice weather and beautiful UCLA campus. Research on the LHC required me to occasionally travel back and forth to Geneva (which didn't require much convincing on my part) and allowed me to meet extremely intelligent people from all over the world.
