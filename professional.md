I am currently towards the end of my PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at UCLA. I have experience as a software engineer before attending graduate school and like to think I know my way around statistics, algorithms developments, cyclotrons, control systems and particle physics. Having spent years studying the arcane world of particle physics, I hope to move into a field where clever ideas are needed to solve problems that have a real impact on our future. A condensed version of my resume can be found in the sidebar with more details contained below

## Physics

Academic
: 2014 - B.A. in Physics from Boston University *cum laude*
: 2017 - M.S. in Physics from UCLA

Publications
: W.Nash, C.Grefe, “*Beam Profiling through Wire Chamber Tracking*”, [LCD-Note-2013-009][beam-profiling], 2013

<!-- Teaching
: I have taught... -->

Comprehensive Exam
: Physics doctoral students must pass a comprehensive [exam][exam] at UCLA in order to continue their studies. I wrote [these notes][notes] while studying, which cover roughly all the material an undergraduate should know at the end of their Bachelor's degree.

## Statistics

<!-- My research involves ... -->


Profile Likelihood
: My statistics course [final project][likelihood] covers an exact solution I had derived to profile nuisance parameters for the multinomial distribution
: The general idea is that if the Likelihood function is dependent on many variables, you can "profile" out the variables you don't need (called nuisance parameters).

## Software

Languages
: `python`
: `C++`
: `LaTeX`


Programs

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
